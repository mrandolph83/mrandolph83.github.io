<p>I am 36 years old and have a wife and 3 kids (7, 4, 3) who mean the world to me. I am based out of Cincinnati, OH, and am currently using my time being laid off due to COVID to transition from being in the video production and AV/Live Event industries to a new career in tech. I hope that by sharing my thoughts along my journey that it will eventually inspire someone else to pull the trigger on a career change themselves.</p>
