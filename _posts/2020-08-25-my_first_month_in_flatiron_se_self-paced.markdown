I've been in Flatiron a month now, and after taking a week off and coming back from a family vacation, I wanted to take a moment to assess things that have gone well so far, as well as things I'd like to change and/or focus on more going in to month 2.

THE GOOD

- From day 1 I started a Google Doc, where I keep notes organized and easy to access. I did this at a previous job as an audio visual tech. Having a background in video production, there was a lot of new information that was thrown at me on-the-fly, and after a few months I realized how important it was to have an way to keep that knowledge easily accessible. While there are a lot of resources out there that I could find through a Google search, etc, I like the idea of having ideas trnsposed my way, in words and images that I choose, so I can be refreshed quickly when problems come up. 

- Also from day 1 I have been using the [Clockify](https://clockify.me/tracker) time tracker, a free app you can use on Desktop or Mobile to track your time. Being a dad of 3 little ones and having a working wife, getting in school time is scattered, sometimes inconsistent, and hard to know if I'm putting the time in I need to to complete this program at the pace I want to. This app allows me to be clock in and out, and track what I'm working on and how much time it is taking, and look back on that data as far as how much time I'm putting in each week, each month, etc.

- I've found that forcing myself to pause and type out all of the code presented in each lesson really helps me slow down and get a bit more retention of the information down the line. Coming from the world of video editing, I know that muscle memory in your fingers can really enhance your efficiency down the line. 

- This is me personally, but there is something about working on this at night, with some ambient instrumental music, that really helps me get into the flow of things. I like to listen to a radio show called [Echoes](https://echoes.org/) that plays on my local NPR station from 10pm-12am on weekdays, and keep adding to a Spotify playlist some of my favorite artists and songs. 

- I really like the variety of streamed and recorded content, very helpful for me to have a better sense of community and to take in information even at times when I can't physically be at the computer 

THE BAD

- It's a real learning curve to do this stuff, and I'm still pretty much in the basics. I've tended to overthink a lot of the labs and been really stuck, then after talking through things with one of the tech advisors realizing it's something much simpler than I thought. Flatiron does things in a way where you have to think critically, which I need to adjust to some aspects of. 


- Did not get as much time in month 1 as I would have liked, averaging about 15 hours a week. Doing this with a life around you is not easy. Having the experience of being an at-home freelancer, the same challenges come up, because there is no external bod governing your schedule, it's entirely up to ME. This next month my wife and I will be having a more rigid schedule to get me to 30 hours a week during the weekdays, and safeguards in place on the weekends for me to make uo the time for when life got in the way.

WHERE I'M AT TODAY

I'm looking forward to continuing my coding journey in the next month, and the additional things I'm going to learn with devoting more weekly time for my studies. Even though this is going to be hard (I heard it compared to a marathon), I know the fruits of this will be worth it for myself and my family. After reviewing the notes I have taken thus far, I came upon this graphic, from one of the first lessons we had. Might have to take this out an frame it, to be more ok with learning difficult new things:
